## Goals
The goals of this Shopping Cart project was to practice my newly acquired knowledge on React Router & to practice using Jest with React for unit tests.

## Challenges
There were a few challenges for this project. The first one was figuring out how to move React state through routes, which ended up being very simple, you simply pass it as a prop through the Route component. The second challenge was figuring out how to save the cart items in session Storage & loading it after a page refresh with useEffect. The third one was testing React with Jest in general. I had to go through some errors that gave me a bit of a headache, and had to go back to the docs to make sure I knew everything I needed to write good React tests.

## What I could've done better
- The UI could definitely use some work. I could have made the site look better.

## Used
